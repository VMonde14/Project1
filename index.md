## The Experiment

It is the future and deforestation has ravaged many of Earth's natural forests. Now, people are panicking and scientists are scrambling to find a tree alternative. One woman, though, saw this problem coming. For the past 40 years, she's been away from society developing a mixture to grow trees at rapid speed. 

This project's goals was to create an immersive environment with a narrative. With this house, you get a sense of who this woman is and how she's lived her life.

The user is dropped into this position as a sort of "intruder" and these snapshots are from an experiment that, perhaps, has just gone wrong. There is a spilled beaker, a tree without any leaves, and no sign of the woman that you can see, however, there is a door open that seems to be leading to some kind of basement. 

### The Process

I really struggled with setting up this project. I wanted to make sure I got it off on the right foot and, thus, restarted it about three times before I was satisfied. I couldn't decide whether or not to start with the outside or inside of the house. I ended up deciding to focus on the interior, as this is where I felt the most narration could occur the most. Once I got the basic layout of the house done, just using the basic cube game objects, I decided to start looking in the Unity Asset Store. Specifically, I wanted some basic furniture and lab equipment. I also used the low poly forest pack that we used in our bonsai lab. Additionally, I wanted some paintings and a hardwood floor texture. 

Here are the links to the assets I used!

I was so proud of the little house I had created! I ran into a bit of an issue with the ceiling, as I didn't realize planes could only be viewed from one side, but I just needed to spin it around and then it was a proper ceiling.

When it came time for lighting, I was a little frustrated because the baked lighting looked amazing except for one crucial piece: the coffee table. It was super unlit even though it was marked as static and had the same properties as the other tables/furniture in the room. Since this was almost the focal point of the scene, it was very frustrating that I couldn't get the lighting how I wanted it. But oh well, it wasn't the end of the world. Next project, I hope to dedicate more time to lighting and animating the scene, as those are two things I definitely did not prioritize.
