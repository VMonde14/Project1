# Project 1: The Experiment

A beginning look at environmental storytelling for the Alternate Realities class in Spring 2022. Step into the living room of an old scientist, but she is nowhere in sight and there is a spilled beaker, a leaf-less tree, and a strange green liquid on the coffee table. 

## Technical setup instructions

Download the "Project 1" file and open in unity! 

## Special controls 

As of right now, there is no navigation. Explore the room in the "Scene" view or examine the room from a specific angle in the "Game" view. Enjoy!
